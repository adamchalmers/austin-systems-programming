    <h2><span class="ping">#</span>About</h2>
    <p>We're focused on high-quality talks from engineers about what they've built or learned recently. Not product pitches. We welcome anyone interested in digging below their abstractions, learning how their systems work and how to make their own. We learn by teaching, so if anything is unclear or confusing, we make time to figure it out as a group.</p>
    <p>Speakers will share their experience building, debugging, testing, and maintaining:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compilers, parsers, virtual machines, IDEs, profiling, etc.</li>
      <li>Databases, storage, networking, distributed systems</li>
      <li>Large scale infrastructure, low latency, high availability services</li>
      <li>Formal methods, verification</li>
      <li>Browsers, kernel development, security, etc.</li>
      <li>Anything else in the spirit of curiosity and excitement about how computers really work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Talks are not recorded or available remotely. We meet up in-person. If you're travelling to Austin and would like to give a talk while you're here, please let us know!</p>
